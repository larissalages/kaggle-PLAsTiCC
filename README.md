Codes for the PLAsTiCC Astronomical Classification Competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/PLAsTiCC-2018#description).

The PLAsTiCC Astronomical Classification is an open data challenge to classify simulated astronomical time-series data in preparation for observations from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). 
The aim of this competition is to answer the following question: how well can we classify objects in the sky that vary in brightness from simulated LSST time-series data, with all its challenges of non-representativity?

Each Jupyter notebook in this repository has the description of the code.
